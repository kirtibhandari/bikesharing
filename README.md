## **Overview of the statistical analysis:**

Tableau, a Data Analysis and Visualization tool, ubiquitous in today's professional world, has been used in this project. It is a very popular tool among data analysists because it allows to create assets which are visually appealing and easy for non- technical audience to understand. It helps to create clear and easy grasp data stories that helps stakeholders in making key decisions. It provides tools to create powerful analytic dashboards by using which a clear story can be told and shared easily with others.

### **Purpose:**
In this project it has been used to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company by importing, styling and portraying data accurately. Worksheets, dashboards, and a story to visualize key data from a New York City bike data set, have been created.

Bike-sharing allows tourists to get to know the city and interact with the people who live there and who are using bikes for their commutes. Here, analysis of New York City bike sharing data is to be presented to the investors to convince them to finance the similar bike-sharing business that can be started in city De Moines.

## **Results:**
Visualizations that have been created to analyze the dataset are presented below:

### **1. Checkout Times for Users:**

This visualization describes how many users used what number of bikes for how much duration of time for their trips at various checkout times. Through this visualization, we can see that maximum number of bikes, 146,752, were taken for ride for 5 minutes. There were 33 bikes that were taken ride for approximately 3 hours. The longer the duration of the trips for rides, the lesser the number of bikes or riders as per a general trend shown.

### **2. Checkout Times by Gender:**

Above visualization shows the trend for checkout times for number of males, females, and    unknown gender type of riders by the duration of their trips. It is clear from the visualization that maximum riders are males. The ratio of female riders is quite on the lower side and very few ridersâ€™ data in unknown.


### **3. Trips by Weekday per Hour:**

![](https://github.com/kirtibhandari/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/trips_by_weekday_per_hour.png) 

This visualization presents the variation in terms of start time of rides what times were most frequent when maximum or lower number of riders started rides, at different times, as per each day of the week as their stop times.

The lighter the color shade, the lesser the number of riders starting their rides at that time. The darker the color, as in the times 7:00 am to 10:00 am and 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm, on weekdays; 12:00 pm to 6:00 pm on Sundays and 9:00 am to 7:00 pm on Saturdays, have riders with varying count but higher to other days and times.

### **4. Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour):**

![](https://github.com/kirtibhandari/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/trips_by_gender_weekday_per_hour.png)

Above visualization presents which gender type, female, male and unknown, started their rides, at what times of the day, and how their ride durations vary. The intensity of the color is the measure showing, for instance, that male riders are maximum riders, and they took rides from 7:00 am to 10:00 am and 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm on weekdays. 

### **5.	Gender by Weekday:**

![](https://github.com/kirtibhandari/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/gender_by_weekday.png)

This visualization shows, out of the total riders, how many were Customers and how many were subscribers. In addition, which type of User and Gender, and on which days of the week, these riders drove most. Clearly, males, who are subscribers, drove most, on Thursdays, Fridays, Mondays, Tuesdays, Saturdays, Wednesdays, and Sundays in order of most to least.

We also have the filters which we can use to separately analyse the data based upon a gender type and user type.

### **6.	Gender Breakdown (Total Rides per Gender):**

![](https://github.com/kirtibhandari/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/gender_breakdown.png)


Above visualization shows the distribution in the form of a pie chart where there are 3 colors, representing each gender type, such as orange representing males, blue representing females and red representing those whose gender is unknown, as per the available dataset. We can clearly differentiate that maximum riders are male riders. Then we have female riders lesser than male and unknown gender type as the least number.

### **7.	Gender Breakdown (Total Rides per User & Gender Type):**

![](https://github.com/kirtibhandari/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/trips_by_usertype_and_gendertype.png)

In the above visualization, it has been shown that out of all three gender types, how many were subscribers and how many were customers who used the citibike services from time to time and not as subscribed to the services.

From the same graph, we can take another perspective that how many customers were male, female and of unknown type data. Similarly, how many subscribers were male, female and of the unknown gender type.

Clearly, out of all types of users and genders, maximum riders are male subscribers. On the other hand, we have customers whose gender is unknown, as maximum riders.

### **8.	Average Trip Duration (by Age of Rider):**

![](https://github.com/kirtibhandari/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/avg_trip_duration.png)

This visualization represents how long is the trip duration as the riders get older. General observation that the younger rider, the longer the trip duration. Though, there are certain exceptions for birth year 1891 and year 1969 which can be treated as outliers. But, more or less, there is a consistent trip duration with not that much of a difference in trip durations from year 1947 to 1994. On the other hand, trip duration varied more steeply from year 1885 to 1946. But again, there could be many factors involved such as people who want to try these services, people who could afford it, availability of services at different locations and many more.

### **9.	Average Trip Duration (by Gender):**

![](https://github.com/kirtibhandari/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/avg_trip_duration_by_gender.png)

In the visualization above, we can see how the trip duration varied, by gender, meaning thereby which gender did ride these bikes for a longer duration of time as compared to others. Above, we see , for the most riders, we have 'Unknown' as gender type for their information in the data which makes it probable to think that this might be an optional section which was filled by some and not almost all riders and some might be comfortable in filling in the value for that field in the registration form. But we cannot say it definitely. As of the available results, we have , on the second number after 'Unknown' gender type, we see 'Female' riders had longer trip duration than 'male' riders.

### **10. Rides by Start Station:**

![](https://github.com/kirtibhandari/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/rides_by_start_station.png)

 In this visualization that looks beautiful, we are able to see which stations have the highest or lowest number of rides as the 'Start Station' for the riders of citibike services. The bigger the size of circle, the greater the count of rides that began from selected station and vice versa. This might help in working on reasons for stations that have not been able to become start stations or reallocation of number of bikes which have high demand and proportionately increasing or decreasing  the number of bikes att relevant stations pending upon the requirements based upon multiple factors of stations, one of which can be the location of the station depending upon more commuters, age of populations present, businesses present and many more factors, in addition to which, this visualization might support the stake holders to decide upon optimum performance of available resources and requirement to infuse more resources into the business. Also, if only certain stations are focus of requirement, can be chosen from filter provided along side it to see details about that particular start station, by name.

## **Summary:**

Based upon the visualizations obtained in the analysis process, it is evident that maximum riders are of 'male' gender type and 'subscriber' user type, in terms of **count**. 

In terms of **usage of services**, most riders utilized these services on weekdays as compared to weekends, and peak hours were  7:00 am to 10:00 am and 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm, on weekdays; 12:00 pm to 6:00 pm on Sundays and 9:00 am to 7:00 pm on Saturdays.


On the other hand, the riders who ride for **longer duration of time**, we have 'unknown' gender type for the riders, 'female' on second number and 'males', least. And if we see **age-wise trip duration**, its more or less consistent after a certain year of birth.

For **checkout times**, by users, we have 5 minute to 40 minutes, leaving out the outlier values for number of bikes in use at bikes checked ou for less tha 5 minutes and longer than 40 minutes as per the visualization obtained, where again, it was 'male' riders who had maximum duration of trips' checkout times.

We have **rides by start station** visualization that can play in important role is re-distribution of bikes and other decisions related to bike maintenance, opening up more spots, infusing more bikes at places in demand and much more.

### **Additional Visualizations' Suggestions:**
- On the basis of start stations latitude/longitude, combined with stop stations latitude/longitude, we can identify routes using map type visualizations, which need more bikes or bike stations or lesser, when optimizing the available resources, by res=- distribution. On the other hand, the same visualization can be used to see where more bikes and bike stations are required when we want to expand the business or low it down to balance in return on investment and profits achieved.

- Another visualization can be created for average trip duration by 'User type' so that we can see which type of user rides the bike they picked up, for what duration of time.
